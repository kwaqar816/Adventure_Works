## Project Description
This project focuses on providing insights and analysis of data from Adventure Works, a bicycle company. The analysis covers various aspects of the company's operations, including sales, product performance, customer behavior, and more. The analysis is presented through interactive visualizations created using Microsoft Power BI.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project was provided by Adventure Works and includes information on sales, products, customers, and other relevant metrics. The dataset was initially raw and required preprocessing to ensure data quality.

## Data Cleaning
Before analysis, the raw data underwent thorough cleaning to ensure its reliability. Data cleaning involved handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.

## Data Visualization
